English to Bengali Text Translator

This Python script translates English text to Bengali using the Google Translate API.

Usage:

1. Place the English text you want to translate in a file named input.txt in the same directory as the script.

2. Run the script TranslatorEnglishToBangla.py using Python. It will read the English text from input.txt, translate it to Bengali, and save the translated text to output.txt.

Example:

Suppose input.txt contains the following English text:

Hello, how are you?

After running the script, output.txt will contain the translated Bengali text:

হ্যালো, আপনি কেমন আছেন?

Prerequisites:

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- googletrans library (version 4.0.0-rc1) installed. You can install it via pip:

  pip install googletrans==4.0.0-rc1

Troubleshooting:

- Ensure that you have an active internet connection as the script requires internet access to communicate with the Google Translate API.
- Be mindful of the usage limits imposed by the Google Translate API. Exceeding these limits may result in errors or restricted access.
